- [The Array: The Foundational Data Structure](((63f8d10f-0b2d-4f99-bcb2-eb1fe25e4257)))
	- An array is a collection of data items that are stored in contiguous memory locations and have the same data type (p. 3).
	- Arrays have two main properties: size and capacity (p. 4).
		- Size is the number of elements currently stored in the array.
		- Capacity is the maximum number of elements that can be stored in the array.
	- Arrays support three basic operations: reading, writing, and resizing (p. 5-6).
		- Reading is accessing an element at a given index.
		- Writing is modifying an element at a given index.
		- Resizing is changing the capacity of the array by creating a new array and copying the elements over.
- [Measuring Speed](((63f8d142-23fe-4ccf-8476-509fbf5fb316)))
	- Speed is how fast an algorithm or a program can perform a task (p. 7).
	- Speed can be measured by counting the number of basic operations that are executed by an algorithm or a program (p. 7-8).
		- Basic operations are simple instructions that take constant time to execute, such as arithmetic operations, comparisons, assignments, etc.
		- The number of basic operations depends on the input size and the algorithm logic.
	- Speed can also be measured by using time complexity analysis (p. 9-10).
		- Time complexity analysis is a way of expressing how fast an algorithm grows as a function of its input size.
		- Time complexity analysis uses big-O notation to describe the worst-case scenario of an algorithm's performance.
- [Reading](((63f8d1c5-fd34-4984-9db2-dd3dffccf4c7)))
	- Reading is accessing an element at a given index in an array (p. 5).
	- Reading takes constant time because it only requires one basic operation: finding the memory address of the element by adding its index to the base address of the array (p. 5).
	- The speed of reading does not depend on the input size or the position of the element (p. 5).
- [Searching](((63f8d1ee-1dba-4e79-b0bc-1592fa9ce5f7)))
	- Searching is finding an element that matches a given value in an array (p. 8).
	- Searching takes linear time because it requires looping through the array and comparing each element with the value until a match is found or the end of the array is reached (p. 8-9).
	- The speed of searching depends on the input size and the position of the element (p. 9).
	- The best case is when the element is at the first index and only one comparison is needed.
	- The worst case is when the element is not in the array or at the last index and n comparisons are needed, where n is the size of the array.
	- The average case is when the element is somewhere in between and n/2 comparisons are needed.
- [Insertion](((63f8d227-e3ba-4f94-8c21-4c6c0a57cb2c))) (p.11-13)
	- Inserting an element into an array means adding a new value at a specific index
	- To insert an element, we need to shift all the elements after that index one position to the right
	- This requires looping through the array from right to left and copying each element to its next position
	- The last element may be lost if the array is full
	- Insertion takes O(N) time because we need to loop through N elements in the worst case
- [Deletion](((63f8d237-27b4-4ce7-8ea2-41de61c51dcf))) (p.13-15)
	- Deleting an element from an array means removing a value at a specific index
	- To delete an element, we need to shift all the elements after that index one position to the left
	- This requires looping through the array from left to right and copying each element to its previous position
	- The first element may be empty if we delete the last element
	- Deletion takes O(N) time because we need to loop through N elements in the worst case
- [Sets: How a Single Rule Can Affect Efficiency](((63f8d271-b5f2-47af-898d-6d02ce032495))) (p.15-18)
	- A set is a data structure that only allows unique values, no duplicates
	- To implement a set using an array, we need to check if a value already exists before inserting it
	- This requires looping through the array and comparing each element with the new value
	- Checking for uniqueness takes O(N) time because we need to loop through N elements in the worst case
	- A hash table can be used instead of an array to implement a set more efficiently
	- A hash table uses a hash function to map each value to an index in another array called buckets
	- To check for uniqueness, we only need to calculate the hash of the new value and look up its corresponding bucket
	- If there is no collision (two values mapping to the same bucket), checking for uniqueness takes O(1) time because we only need one operation
- ### [Exercises](((63f7a74f-d0c3-4d0c-a571-84c127a2748a)))
	- 1. For an array containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps the following operations would take:
		- a. Reading - 1 step because array's address addition take one step
		  b. Searching for a value not contained within the array - 100 elements because array doesn't have starting address to add
		  c. Insertion at the beginning of the array - take N + 1 step for shifting and inserting
		  d. Insertion at the end of the array - take only one step
		  e. Deletion at the beginning of the array -  N steps delete, then shift
		  f. Deletion at the end of the array - take only one step
	- 2. For an array-based set containing 100 elements, provide the number of steps the following operations would take:
		- a. Reading - take 1 step
		- b. Searching for a value not contained within the array - take N steps
		- c. Insertion of a new value at the beginning of the set - 2N + 1 steps
		- d. Insertion of a new value at the end of the set - N + 1 steps
		- e. Deletion at the beginning of the set - N steps
		- f. Deletion at the end of the set - 1 step
	- 3. Normally the search operation in an array looks for the first instance of a given value. But sometimes we may want to look for every instance of a given value. For example, say we want to count how many times the value “apple” is found inside an array. How many steps would it take to find all the “apples”? Give your answer in terms of N.
		- This will take N steps because we need to inspect everything
