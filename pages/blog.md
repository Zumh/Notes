- ## Black magic and Black Hat hacking
  collapsed:: true

	  * These two things are so similar that we can't just ignore how they work.
	- Why Black magic?
	  * In black magic like hexing, a witch must come up with ingredients, protocols, rules and physically some how place a hex back to the target home or house.
	  * Similarly, a black hat hacker must come up with algorithms, protocols, and remotely or physically inject the software to a victim's device. 
	  * The fundamental strategies are:
	  * how the target work? close enough is good enough
	  * what do we want to do with the target? 
	  * Is it possible for target to trace us back?
	  * What is the easiest way to inject or place our tool in victim's device/place?
	  * What is plan B? If shit happened what should we do?
	- What we learned?
- ## What is a healthy software developer?
  collapsed:: true
	- Anything healthy have have discipline and good time management.
	  There motivation is in **growth** not feeling bad if they couldn't figure out by themselves.
	- I struggle with this and imposter syndrome really stop my growth.
	- Making mistakes or being stupid for good reasons is better than knowing everything but didn't take actions.
	- Our job is to "understand" how things work.
	  * If there is best solution then use that solution. No need to re-invent the wheel
	  * Solving problem needs understanding and puzzling piciese. 
	  * If we cannot solve the problem then we our not expose with enough problems. 
	  * When solving problems understanding the "patterns", purpose and design is important.
- ## Effective and Effecient way to *understand* in engineering
	- ### Disassemble and Assemble
		- Find a product or sample or code or something close enough
		- Disassemble it and take notes base on your previous knowledge
		- Draw diagrams and write down how you think it work.
		- Disable or comment some parts and see how it work
		- Use debugging technique
	- ### Building
		- Understand the problem and goal we want to achieve
		- Draw a diagram or write pseudocode
		- Stop when we find something is missing and re-build base on the drawing.
