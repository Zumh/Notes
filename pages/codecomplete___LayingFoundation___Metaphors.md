- ## Metaphors
	- Heuristic and can be sloppy and algorithm can be straight forward
	- There are better metaphors that suite what needs to be done
- ## Modeling
	- Important of modeling - 
	  By comparing a topic you understand poorly to something similar you understand better, you can come up with insights that result in a better understanding of the less-familiar topic.
	- In effect, metaphors are a way of internalizing and abstracting
	  concepts, allowing one's thinking to be on a higher plane and low-level
	  mistakes to be avoided
	- Data processing view from a stream of cards to focus on database-centred view - Bachman  1970s
	- Less inclusive to more Inclusive.
- ## Accretion or incremental metaphor

	- Just like Oyster makes a pearl by gradually adding small amounts of calcium
	- No overpromise
	- Incremental, iterative, adaptive, and evolutionary
	- Building software with incremental
	  collapsed:: true
		- designing or planning, preparation, building or execution and testing
	- In practice
	  collapsed:: true
		- Dummy classes to real classes
		- Dummy input to real input
- ## Building house and Software constructions
	- construction analogy is good for large software projects.
	- Greater complexity and size need a better design - labor cost is expensive
	- Don't build things you can already buy or built-in
	- But sometime we need customization of a software just to fit your need
	- Needs appropriate level of planning - to avoid hard to code, test, and debug
	- Need well plan not over detail plan
	- pay more money for preparation than letting the project fail with expensive costs.
