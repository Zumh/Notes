- Selection sort: a sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the smallest element in an array and moves it to a new array (pp. 63-70)
- The efficiency of selection sort: how to measure the number of steps and compare it with bubble sort using Big O notation (pp. 70-72)
- Ignoring constants: how to simplify Big O expressions by ignoring constant factors that do not affect the growth rate of steps (pp. 71-72)
- Big O categories: how to classify algorithms into different categories based on 
  - their efficiency and growth rate, such as constant, linear, logarithmic, quadratic, exponential etc. (pp. 72-76)
- Selection sort is a way of sorting an array from smallest to largest by doing this:
  1. Look at all the elements in the array and find the smallest one.
  2. Remove it from the array and put it in a new array.
  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there are no more elements left in the original array.
  
  The result is a new array that has all the elements sorted..
