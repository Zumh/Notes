	- A common denominator of programmers who build high-quality software is their use of high-quality practices.
	- Such practices emphasize quality at the beginning, middle, and end of a project.
	- ## Boss-Readiness Test
		- We've investigated requirements and design so much that I can't think of any major problems we'll run into during coding or debugging.
	- ## Determine the Kind of Software You're Working On

		- Business Systems
			- benefit from highly iterative approaches, in which planning, requirements, and architecture are interleaved with construction, system testing, and quality-assurance activities
		- Mission Critical Systems
			- sequential approaches— requirements stability is part of what's needed to ensure ultrahigh levels of reliability
		- Embedded Life-Critical Systems
			- sequential plus requirement
		- Rule of thumb
			- One common rule of thumb is to plan to specify about 80 percent of the requirements up front, allocate time for additional requirements to be specified later, and then practice systematic change control to accept only the most valuable new requirements as the project progresses.
			- Another alternative is to specify only the most important 20 percent of the requirements up front and plan to develop the rest of the software in small increments, specifying additional requirements and designs as you go.
	- ## Choosing Between Iterative and Sequential Approaches
	  ((63f3ddb7-43e1-4d8a-8db4-897d1c5947a1))
		- ## Sequential
			- The requirements are fairly stable.
			- The design is straightforward and fairly well understood.
			- The development team is familiar with the applications area.
			- The project contains little risk. Long-term predictability is important.
			- The cost of changing requirements, design, and code downstream is likely to be high.
		- ## Iterative Approach
			- The requirements are not well understood or you expect them to be unstable for other reasons.
			- The design is complex, challenging, or both.
			- The development team is unfamiliar with the applications area.
			- The project contains a lot of risk.
			- Long-term predictability is not important.
			- The cost of changing requirements, design, and code downstream is likely to be low.
