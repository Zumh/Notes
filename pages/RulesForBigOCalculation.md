- To calculate an algorithm's Big O notation, you can follow these rules:
- 1. Drop the constants: Ignore any constant factors in the algorithm. For example, if an algorithm has a running time of 3n^2 + 5n + 7, you would simplify it to O(n^2).
- 2. Drop the non-dominant terms: If an algorithm has multiple terms in its running time, keep only the one with the largest growth rate. For example, if an algorithm has a running time of n^3 + 2n^2 + 5n, you would simplify it to O(n^3).
- 3. Add the running times of separate steps: If an algorithm consists of multiple steps with different running times, add the running times of the steps together. For example, if an algorithm has a sorting step with a running time of O(n log n) and a searching step with a running time of O(n), the overall running time would be O(n log n + n) = O(n log n).
- 4. Multiply the running times of nested steps: If an algorithm consists of nested loops or other nested steps, multiply their running times together. For example, if an algorithm has a nested loop with a running time of O(n^2) and another nested loop inside it with a running time of O(n), the overall running time would be O(n^2 * n) = O(n^3).
- 5. Use the most significant term: If an algorithm's running time is a polynomial with multiple terms, use the term with the highest exponent as the basis for the Big O notation. For example, if an algorithm has a running time of n^3 + 2n^2 + 5n + 10, the overall running time would be O(n^3).
- Remember that Big O notation is an upper bound on an algorithm's running time, so it is important to consider the worst-case scenario. Additionally, it is important to note that Big O notation only tells us about the growth rate of an algorithm, not its actual running time.
